**Step 2:** Paste the pathway to the _pixelator executable into the terminal and press enter. If you don't know where the exe is, you can find its location in the Show>Shell Command setting of the Pixelator application.  
**Step 3:** Paste the pathway to the raw _folder_ into the terminal and press enter.
